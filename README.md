# Junglepedia

It's a jungle out there! Junglepedia is a responsive, mobile-friendly app that uses HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and vanilla JavaScript to allow you to get lost in the rabbithole that is Wikipedia's API.

See it in action [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jesrah/junglepedia/blob/master/index.html).
